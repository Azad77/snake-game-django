# How It Works ⚙️
## Backend
* Views: The game page is rendered using a Django view (snake/views.py).
* Routing: URLs are mapped to views via urls.py.
# Frontend
* HTML: The game interface is defined in templates/snake/game.html.
* CSS: The look and feel are managed by static/snake/css/style.css.
* JavaScript: Game mechanics (movement, collision, food generation) are handled in static/snake/js/game.js.
# Key Features of the Snake Game 🐍
* Dynamic Gameplay: Real-time snake movement and food collection.
* Collision Detection: Game resets on wall or self-collision.
* Random Food Placement: Food appears randomly on the grid.
